## Introduction
We live in a world that is filled with dangers and uncertainties. People, homes, businesses, buildings, and property are all vulnerable to various types of risk, and these risks might differ. These threats include the risk of death, illness, and the loss of property or possessions. People’s lives revolve around their health and happiness.

However, because risks cannot always be avoided, the financial sector has devised a number of products to protect individuals and organisations from them by utilizing financial resources to compensate them. As a result, insurance is a policy that reduces or eliminates the expenses of various risks. A policy that protects medical bills is known as health insurance.

An individual who has purchased a health insurance policy receives coverage after paying a certain premium. The cost of health insurance is determined by a variety of factors. The cost of a health insurance policy premium varies from person to person since various factors influence the cost of a health insurance plan.

Consider age: a young individual is far less likely than an older person to suffer serious health issues. As a result, treating an elderly person is more expensive than treating a young one. As a result, an older individual must pay a higher premium than a younger person. Because of numerous factors influence the insurance premium of a health insurance policy, the premium amount varies from person to person.
